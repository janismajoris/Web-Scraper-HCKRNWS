# Advanced Hacker News Scraper

## Description

This Python project is an advanced scraper for extracting the top articles from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). It is designed with a focus on robustness, utilizing sessions, custom headers, and error handling to efficiently and reliably parse article titles, links, and scores. 

## Purpose

The Advanced Hacker News Scraper serves as an educational tool for intermediate to advanced Python developers interested in learning more about web scraping, session management, and advanced error handling in Python. It showcases how to implement a more complex and robust scraping solution capable of handling real-world challenges such as web request errors and dynamic content parsing.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**: The primary programming language used for the script.
- **Requests**: A Python library for making HTTP requests in a simpler and more human-friendly way.
- **Beautiful Soup 4**: A Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It provides idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
- **urllib.parse**: A module in Python's standard library used for parsing URLs.
- **Logging**: A module in Python's standard library used for logging events during script execution.

## Features

- **Custom User-Agent**: Mimics a real web browser to reduce the likelihood of being blocked by the website.
- **Session Management**: Utilizes a session object to persist certain parameters across requests.
- **Error Handling**: Implements try-except blocks to gracefully handle potential request errors.
- **Logging**: Uses Python's built-in logging module to log informational messages and errors.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`.
3. Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.
4. Run the script using `python hacker_news_scraper.py`.

## Example Output

The script will output the top articles from Hacker News in the following format:

## Best Practices

- **Respect `robots.txt`**: Always check the `robots.txt` file of the target website to ensure compliance with their scraping policies.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement delays between requests to avoid overwhelming the website's server.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and logging are essential for debugging and maintaining the script.
